      <p>Currently in Italy there are <span class="difference"></span> more inmates than what the system is designed to
        host, althoguh the situation is probably worse. In fact, the official regular capacity of the country's
        detention system - which currenty stands at <span class="capacity"></span>
        places - does not account of
        missing spots.</p>

      <p>
        Despite many OpenData initiatives, the Ministry of Justice provides data regarding inmate population in a format
        that is not machine readable. Every month, associations working to protect the
        rights of people deprived of liberty - such as the nonprofit organization Antigone - are forced into tedious
        data collection work, often
        manual, which leaves a lot of room for errors and consumes many resources and time.</p>
      <p>To address this issue, I
        began a project aimed at collecting and processing the data made available by the Ministry in a way that make it
        more useful to those who need them. Every number included in the current page is automatically updated every
        15th of the month, when a scraper is set up to visit the Ministry website, collect and process the data. Code
        and data collected so can be accessed on <a href="https://www.github.io">GitHub.</a></p>

        <p class="title is-2">Prison overcrowding, where do we stand compared to the regulatory capacity</p>
        <p> At the beginning of 2020, the irruption of COVID-19 in Italy convinced the authorities to lower presences in
          detention centers to slow the contagion and reduce risks for the imprisoned population. Despite that
          initiative, even during the high of the pandemic the amount of people in detention centers was above the
          official regular capacity.</p>
        <p>Since the pandemic stopped being an emergency, detention centers around the country went back to increasing
          the hosted population of inmates. Soon, Italy might reach the record levels reached in 2010, when Italy -
          which at that time had about one million more residents - hosted almost 68,000 inmates. </p>

      <p>On average, those numbers mean that across all of 189 Italy's
        detention cetners there are <span class="rate"></span> inmates for every regular spot. However, this situation
        is probably worse.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="title is-2">Regular Capacity is not Real Capacity</p>
      <p>The Italian Ministry of Justice publishes monthly bulletins containing information regarding the presence of
        inmatess inside the about 189 detention centers across the country. However, data regarding the actual capacity
        of detention centers is not provided with the same times.</p>
      <p>The most recent data containing information about the actual capacity from detention centers is from <span
          class="date_real"></span>. In that moment in time there were <span class="capacity_real"></span> avilable
        spaces in the Italian detention system. That means that <spanc class="difference_institutes"></spanc> places
        that were supposed to be available, were not. That is approximately one every <span class="ratio"></span> spots.

      <p>Although the situation on average is one amoong Europe's worst, one has to look to specific cases to see in

      <p>The following table shows the ten detention centers with the highest real overcrowding index, as per latest
        available data which in this case is <span class="date_real"></span>, when across all the country there were

        less than what were supposed to be.</p>
