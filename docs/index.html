      <p>Currently in Italy there are <span class="difference"></span> more inmates than what the system is designed to
        host. Still, the situation is probably worse as the official regular capacity of <span class="capacity"></span>
        places does not account of
        missing spots.</p>

      <p>
        After consulting the numbers from the Ministry of Justice, I noticed that - despite OpenData initiatives - the
        ministry's data is provided in a format that is not particularly convenient. Associations that deal with the
        rights of detainees - such as Antigone - are therefore forced into tedious data collection work, sometimes
        manual, which leaves a lot of room for errors and consumes many resources and time. To address this issue, I
        initiated a project to collect and systematize the data made available by the Ministry in order to make them
        more useful to those who need them. All the numbers included on the current page are automatically updated every
        15th of the month. The methodology and data collected so far are freely accessible on <a
          href="https://www.github.io">GitHub.</a></p>

      <p>These situation hints towards a situation of absolute emergency for Italian prisons. On average, across all
        detention cetners there are <span class="rate"></span> inmates for every regular spot. However, this situation
        is probably an optimistic estimate.</p>
      <p class="title is-2">Regular Capacity is not Real Capacity</p>
      <p>The Italian Ministry of Justice publishes monthly bulletins containing information regarding the presence of
        inmatess inside the about 189 detention centers across the country. However, data regarding the actual capacity
        of detention centers is not provided with the same times.</p>
      <p>The most recent data containing information about the actual capacity from detention centers is from <span
          class="date_real"></span>. In that moment in time there were <span class="capacity_real"></span> avilable
        spaces in the Italian detention system. That means that <spanc class="difference_institutes"></spanc> places
        that were supposed to be available, were not. That is approximately one  every <span class="ratio"></span> spots.
